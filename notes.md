**Types of Tests:**

- Unit Tests
Usually pretty simple, test whether a single method will spit out the correct outputs based on inputs you give it
- Integration Tests
More complex, you usually have to spin up a server, hit an endpoint, maybe DB up and running - usually backend stuff
- E2E Tests
Pull up the entire application and go through - as close as possible - it like an end user would
- Acceptance Tests
- Regression Tests
- Performance Tests
- Stress Tests
- Penetration Tests
